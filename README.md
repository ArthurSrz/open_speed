# Open Speed
Quick data project to understand different public administration profiles based on their opening speed. 

I used the datasets from the [French Open Data Observatory](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organizations/association-opendatafrance/#/datasets) (made by Open Data France)

Considered 3 profiles :

1. the “one-shotter" concerning administration opening data one year then letting things down
2. the “long-runner” who open more and more data, slowly but regulargly
3. the "down-slopper" who open less and less data accross the years.

## Result 

⚠️ The plot is a just a first work-in-progress graph ! Code, DataComputation are to be revised by others.
